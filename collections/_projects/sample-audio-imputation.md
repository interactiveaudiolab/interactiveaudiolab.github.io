Audio imputation is the process of re-synthesizing the missing parts of an audio signal so that after the reconstruction the information inside missing parts is seamlessly recovered.

An effective approach for audio imputation could benefit many important applications, such as audio enhancement in telephone system, speech recognition in noisy environment, sound restoration of historical recordings, and improvement of corrupted audio or source separation results, etc.
