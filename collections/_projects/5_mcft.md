The Multi-resolution Common Fate Transform (MCFT) is an audio signal representation developed in the context of audio source separation.

The MCFT:

* Combines the invertibility of the [Common Fate Transform (CFT)](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01248012/document), and  the multi-resolution  property of the cortical stage output of [an auditory model](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.1945807). 

* Explicitly represents spectro-temporal modulation patterns of audio signals and thus facilitates the separation of signals that overlap in the time-frequency domain.

* Has been shown to provide higher separability than the Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT), Constant-Q Transform (CQT), and CFT.
