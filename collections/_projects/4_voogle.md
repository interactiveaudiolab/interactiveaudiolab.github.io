Voogle is an audio search engine that lets users search a database of sounds by vocally imitating or providing an example of the sound they are searching for.

Before Voogle, audio search engines either relied solely on metadata (e.g., matching filenames or keywords) or allowed for content-based search only within a particular domain (e.g., searching for music with Shazam). With Voogle, content-based search can be performed on any audio files--not just music. This is useful for anyone who needs to quickly retrieve specific sound effects (e.g., podcasters, video sound designers, and music producers).

While Voogle is domain-agnostic, incorporating domain-specific information can further improve performance. As an example, our paper [OtoMechanic: Auditory Automobile Diagnostics via Query-by-Example](/assets/papers/mm_bp_dcase_2019_cr.pdf) adapts Voogle to the domain of consumer vehicle diagnostics.
