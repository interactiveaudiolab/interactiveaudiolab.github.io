Alisa is a senior undergraduate studying computer science and math, and identifies with the NLP and computer audition communities. She's done work in audio source separation, common sense QA, and definition modeling. She's recently been thinking a lot about automatic measures of model confidence across different tasks and how they can be used to incorporate human input and domain knowledge to improve model performance.
