Interactive Sound Event Detector (I-SED) is a human-in-the-loop interface for sound event annotation that helps users label sound events of interest within a lengthy recording quickly. The annotation is performed by a collaboration between a user and a machine.

The system lets you reduce the time required to search for a set of sound events of interest in an audio recording when there are too few labeled examples (e.g., one) of the sound class to train a state-of-the-art machine audio labeling system.
