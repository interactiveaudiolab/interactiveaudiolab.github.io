 Our grant "Collaborative Research: FW-HTF-R: Toward an Ecosystem of Artificial-intelligence-powered Music Production (TEAMuP)" has been funded by the National Science Foundation. This work, to be done in collaboration with the University of Rochester, will be to bring next-generation deep-learning-based tools for audio processing (pitch trackers, source separators, effects, etc.) to a broad swath of the professional music community.
