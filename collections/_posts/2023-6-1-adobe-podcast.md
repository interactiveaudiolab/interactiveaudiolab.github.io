Adobe just announced their [Podcast](https://podcast.adobe.com) web-based AI-powered audio editing and recording tools. The Mic Check tool in Podcast applies work from our patent ["Sound quality prediction and interface to facilitate high-quality voice recordings"](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11138989B2/en?inventor=bryan+pardo&oq=bryan+pardo) to ensure users make better recordings. 

See the [Voice Assist video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4LV-9OPYJ0&t=1s) or the our 2019 CHI paper [“VoiceAssist: Guiding Users to High-Quality Voice Recordings”](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/assets/papers/seetharaman_voiceassist_chi19.pdf) for the technical details.
