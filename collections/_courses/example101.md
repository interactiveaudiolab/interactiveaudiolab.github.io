## Course Description
This course covers machine extraction of structure in audio files covering areas such as source separation (unmixing audio recordings into individual component sounds), sound object recognition (labeling sounds), melody tracking, beat tracking, and perceptual mapping of audio to machine-quantifiable measures.

This course is approved for the Breadth Interfaces & project requirement in the CS curriculum.

Prior programming experience sufficient to be able to do laboratory assignments in PYTHON, implementing algorithms and using libraries without being taught to do so (there is no language instruction on Python). Having taken EECS 211 and 214 would demonstrate this experience.

## Policies

### Grading 
You can earn 110 points. You’re graded on a basis of 100 points. In other words… 93 and up is an A, 90 - 92 is an A-, 87-89 is a B+, 83-86 is a B, 80-82 is a B-…and so on.

### Late Policy
Assignments are due on Canvas by 11:59pm on the due date. Canvas is the only way assignments are accepted. Late assignments are docked 2 points per day, starting IMMEDIATELY. For example, an assignment handed in at 12:00am the next day has 2 points removed. An assignment that is 3 days late will have 6 points removed from the final grade.

### Cheating & Academic Dishonesty
Do your own work. Academic dishonesty will be dealt with as laid out in the student handbook. Penalties include failing the class and can be more severe than that. If you have a question about whether something may be considered cheating, ask, prior to submitting your work.

### Attendance
Attendance is not graded.
