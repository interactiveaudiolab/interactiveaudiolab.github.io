Ethan is currently a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind on the Magenta Team. He finished my PhD in Computer Science in 2022 working under Bryan Pardo in the Interactive Audio Lab at Northwestern University. During his PhD, he spent two years as a Student Researcher with Magenta and prior to that, spent a year and half as Student Researcher at MERL on the Speech and Audio Team. His research centers on making machine learning systems that listen to and understand musical audio in an effort to make tools that can better assist artists.
