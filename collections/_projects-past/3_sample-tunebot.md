Tunebot is a search engine that lets you find the music you're looking for by singing a bit of it (or entering music notation). In response to your query it returns a ranked list of songs you can play. These songs are linked to www.amazon.com, where you can purchase the desired music.

Most commercial music search engines, such as Amazon's and Apple's iTunes, index their music by metadata, such as song title, composer name or performer name. What happens if you can't recall this information but still want to find a piece of music? If you already have the recording and just want to know its name, you can play the recording to www.shazam.com. Without the metadata or an example of the recording, none of these services can identify the music. With our search engine, you can find the music you seek, as long as you can sing a bit of it. Our search engine compares what you sing to a database of melodies and returns the melodies that best match your example. You don't need to know the lyrics. You don't have to have a copy of the recording. You just have to have a voice and a microphone.
