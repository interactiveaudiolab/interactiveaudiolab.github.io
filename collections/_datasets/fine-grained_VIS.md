This dataset includes 763 crowd-sourced vocal imitations of 108 sound events. The sound event recordings were taken from a subset of [Vocal Imitation Set](https://zenodo.org/record/1340763).

While the Vocal Imitation Set only contains vocal imitations of a single reference recording per class, this new dataset contains vocal imitations of multiple reference recordings per class.
