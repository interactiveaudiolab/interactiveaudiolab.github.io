The Synthesized Lakh (Slakh) Dataset contains 2100 automatically mixed tracks and accompanying MIDI files synthesized using a professional-grade sampling engine.

The Synthesized Lakh (Slakh) Dataset is a new dataset for audio source separation that is synthesized from the Lakh MIDI Dataset v0.1 using professional-grade sample-based virtual instruments. This first release of Slakh, called Slakh2100, contains 2100 automatically mixed tracks and accompanying MIDI files synthesized using a professional-grade sampling engine. The tracks in Slakh2100 are split into training (1500 tracks), validation (375 tracks), and test (225 tracks) subsets, totaling 145 hours of mixtures.

Slakh is the result of a collaboration between Mitsubishi Electric Research Lab (MERL) and the Interactive Audio Lab.
