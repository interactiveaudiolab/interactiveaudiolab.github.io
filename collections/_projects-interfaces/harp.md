[HARP](https://github.com/audacitorch/HARP/tree/main) is an ARA plug-in that allows for hosted, asynchronous, remote processing of audio with deep learning models. HARP works by routing audio from a digital audio workstation (DAW) through Gradio endpoints. Because Gradio apps can be hosted locally or in the cloud (e.g., HuggingFace Spaces), HARP lets users of Digital Audio Workstations (e.g. Reaper) access large state-of-the-art models in the cloud, without breaking their within-DAW workflow.
