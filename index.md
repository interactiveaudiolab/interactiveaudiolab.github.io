# Welcome to the Interactive Audio Lab! 
<p></p>
#### We develop new methods in **Machine Learning**, **Signal Processing** and **Human Computer Interaction** and apply these advances to problems in the audio domain. 
<p></p>
The lab is headed by [Prof. Bryan Pardo](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~pardo) and is based in the [Computer Science Department of Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/).
