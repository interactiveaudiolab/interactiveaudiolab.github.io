We develop technologies that automatically find, label and manipulate perceptually-important structures in sound, with a focus on music as a problem domain.  We pioneer advances in audio source separation (extracting the sound of one instrument from a string quartet recording), audio database search (matching a sung melody to a Mozart piece available on Amazon.com) and mapping human audio perception to machine-quantifiable measures.
